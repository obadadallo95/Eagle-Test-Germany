---

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

**Every year, 100,000+ immigrants take the German Citizenship Test (Einbürgerungstest).**
- Limited access to quality preparation materials
- Language barriers prevent effective learning
- High costs for integration courses (€1,000-€2,000 per person)
- Geographic barriers (rural areas have fewer resources)
- Time constraints (many work full-time)

**Result:** Lower pass rates, delayed integration, higher costs for government and NGOs.
